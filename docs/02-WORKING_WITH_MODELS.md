- **Medium temperature (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and coherence  
- **High temperature (0.8-1.0)**: More creative and varied responses

## 🔍 Model Capabilities Reference

| Model Type | Best For | Memory Needed | Speed |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Compact Efficiency** | Quick tasks, edge devices | 1-3GB | Ultra-Fast |
| **Single-GPU Champions** | Balanced performance, daily use | 3-8GB | Fast |
| **Reasoning Specialists** | Complex thinking, problem-solving | 12-16GB | Medium |
| **Vision-Language** | Image analysis, multimodal tasks | 8-32GB | Medium |
| **Coding Agents** | Advanced programming, debugging | 12-24GB | Medium |
| **State-of-the-Art** | Maximum capability, research | 32GB+ | Slower |

## 💡 Tips for Better Results

### Writing Better Prompts
- **Be specific**: "Write a 200-word summary" vs "Summarize this"
- **Give context**: "I'm a beginner" or "I'm an expert in..."
- **Ask for examples**: "Show me examples of..."
- **Specify format**: "Give me a numbered list" or "Explain step by step"

### Managing Performance
- **Use smaller models** for simple tasks to save memory
- **Switch models** based on your current task
- **Monitor memory usage** in the Models section
- **Keep frequently used models loaded** for faster responses

### Privacy & Security
✅ **Your data never leaves your computer**
✅ **No internet connection required** (after downloading models)
✅ **Full control over your conversations**
✅ **No tracking or data collection**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Model won't download?**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you have enough disk space
- Try a smaller model first

**Responses are slow?**
- Try a smaller model (1B or 3B parameters)
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Check if multiple models are loaded

**AI gives strange responses?**
- Adjust the temperature setting
- Try rephrasing your question
- Use a different model for your task
